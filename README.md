# FlowNetS in Tensorflow

[FlowNetS](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2015/DFIB15/flownet.pdf) 
implementation in Tensorflow.

Dropout layers integrated in architecture to produce confidence images when evaluating, as introduced 
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf) and integrated [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02680.pdf)
Confidence Image is then used to enable the [Fast Bilateral Solver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf).
