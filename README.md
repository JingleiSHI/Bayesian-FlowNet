# FlowNet in Tensorflow

[FlowNetS](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Publications/2015/DFIB15/flownet.pdf) 
implementation in Tensorflow.

Dropout layers integrated in architecture to produce confidence images when evaluating. 
Confidence Image is needed to enable use of the [Fast Bilateral Solver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf).
